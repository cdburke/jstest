github builds

Whenever the JE repo is updated, the linux/macos/windows binaries are built and standard tests are run.

The process is defined in the repo file: 

  .github/workflows/jsource.yml

This workflow references files in the repo script folder, e.g.

  buildga.cmd  - runs the windows builds
  testga.cmd   - runs the windows tests

The tests start J and call testga.ijs to run the test suite.

Builds take place on runners which are machines created dynamically for each OS. Elapsed time is around 25 minutes for a successful run.

If there is any failure, the entire workflow run is halted for that run.

To see the status of a run, login to github and visit

  https://github.com/jsoftware/jsource/actions 

Recent runs are shown with a status mark. Drill down into a run name for the compile logs.

If a run completes successfully, the JE binaries and test results are written to github area:

  jsource/releases/tag/build 

If the latest commit has any change to the repo version.txt file, then the JE binaries are copied over to a staging area on the J webserver, at 

  download/jengine/staged

From there, they can be copied to a distribution folder, e.g. in jengine run:

  cp -r staged/* j904-beta
